To validate edge weight accuracy and overall model stability, you can perform bootstrapping by selecting `Validation` from the left-hand tab. Bootstrapping involves repeatedly resampling the original data with replacement to generate new datasets, where some data points may appear multiple times while others may be excluded. You can adjust the number of `Iterations`, select the significance `level` (\alpha), and choose between two bootstrapping methods: `stability` or `threshold`. Additionally, you can define the `Consistency range`, which sets the lower and upper bounds of the bootstrap confidence intervals for transitions. Once all parameters are set, click `Bootstrap.` In the resulting network visualization, stable connections will appear in blue, while removed or unstable connections will be shown in red.

Finally, you can adjust the same plot settings as in the Visualization section.
