This tutorial demonstrates the functionalities of the Transition Network Analysis (TNA) Shiny app developed by Sonsoles López-Pernas: [https://sonsoleslp.shinyapps.io/tna-app/](https://sonsoleslp.shinyapps.io/tna-app/). This app is based on the R package of the same name ([tna](https://sonsoles.me/tna)) by Mohammed Saqr, Santtu Tikka, and Sonsoles López-Pernas.

This tutorial uses Sample Data, provided within the TNA app, to showcase the app (see section 2.1).
