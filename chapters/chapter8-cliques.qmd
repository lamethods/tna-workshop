Cliques are subgraphs in which every pair of nodes is directly connected. To find cliques in your network, click on `Cliques` in the left tab. Then, set the `Clique Size (n)` to define how many interconnected nodes each clique should contain. You can also adjust the `Threshold` parameter to include only edges with weights above a specified value. Once your parameters are set, click `Find Cliques`. A detected clique will appear under `Cliques Found`. To view other identified cliques, open the dropdown menu labeled `Choose Clique` and select the one you want to explore.

Finally, you can adjust the same plot settings as in the Visualization section.
