Communities are groups of nodes that are more densely interconnected with each other than with the rest of the network. To explore the communities in your model, click on `Community detection` on the left tab.

You can choose from several algorithms to identify communities within your network. If applicable, you may also set the gamma level to adjust the resolution of detection. Available algorithms:
 
- `walktrap`: detects communities using short random walks.

- `fast_greedy`: uses modularity optimization to find community structure.

- `label_prop`: applies label propagation to assign nodes to communities.

- `infomap`: identifies communities based on information flow.

- `edge_betweenness`: uses edge betweenness centrality to split the network into communities.

- `leading_eigen`: detects communities using the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix.

- `spinglass`: based on the spinglass model from statistical physics.

The number in brackets next to each algorithm indicates the number of communities it detected. In the visualization, communities are represented using distinct node colors.

Finally, you can adjust the same plot settings as in the Visualization section.
