To compare networks of different groups or settings, click on `Comparison` on the left tab. 

Depending on your dataset you can choose different comparison groups by selecting the relevant variable from `Choose grouping column`. If you have more than two groups, you select them in dropdown menus of `Choose group 1` and `Choose group 2`. 

The `Difference` Network will show the difference in edge strength by subtracting the velus from group 2 from group 1. You can also access other metrics regarding group comparison. 

By clicking on `Mosaic`, you can see the mosaic plot of code frequency with statistical significance of the differences. 

`Centralities` show the centralities measures of each code divided by group. Here you can exclude irrelevant centralities by removing their names from the `Centralities` box. To add them back, select from the drop-down list of all available centralities.

To include loops (edges that return to the same code), check the `Loops?` option. 

If you need calculations based on normalized values, check the `Normalize?` box.

The centrality measures table is accompanied by visualizations. You can choose how many columns to use when displaying these visualizations by selecting the correct number in `Columns`.

To compare two models and determine whether their differences are statistically significant, you can perform a `Permutation test` by checking the corresponding box. This test works by repeatedly shuffling and comparing the data to generate a distribution of differences under the null hypothesis. You can also adjust the number of `Iteratations` to control how many permutations are performed, which affects the accuracy of the resulting significance estimate, and set the [`level` - **is this the level of statistical significance?**]{.mark} of stastical significance that you are interested in. Finally, you can also conduct a [`Paired test` - **is this the parametric test? the network did not change much, when I ran it**]{.mark}. When you run the permutation and statistical tests, the `Mosaic` and `Centralities` tabs are automatically updated to reflect the results.

Finally, you can adjust the same plot settings as in the Visualization section.
