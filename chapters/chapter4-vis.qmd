Since all the three analysis methods result into some type of matrix, we can represent them as a network where the nodes (circles) are the actions/codes and the edges (arrows) are the transitions between them (in the case of relative and frequency analysis) or co-occurrence (in the case of the analysis of the same name).

You can find your network visualization under `Visualization` on the left tab.

To explore your network, you can adjust the following **Settings**:

1. `Cut Value`: sets the minimum edge value required for the edge to appear solid (rather than faded) in the graph.

2. `Minimum Value`: sets the lowest edge value that will be displayed in the graph.

3. `Edge Label Size`: adjusts the font size of edge labels. 

4. `Node Size`: controls the visual size of each node.

5. `Node Label Size`: modifies the font size of node labels. 

6. `Layout`: Choose between two layout options:

`Circle`: Positions all nodes in a circular formation, or

`Spring`: Positions all nodes based on an algorithm that simulates a force-directed representation of the network treating edges as springs holding nodes close, while treating nodes as repelling objects.
