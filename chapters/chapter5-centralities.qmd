Click on `Centrality Measures`  in the left tab to view key network metrics for each code, including closeness, out-strength centrality, and diffusion.

- *OutStrength*: Total weight of transitions originating from a code.

- *InStrength*: Total weight of transitions directed toward a code.

- *ClosenessIn*: How easily a code can be reached from all others via incoming paths.

- *ClosenessOut*: How easily a code can reach all others via outgoing paths.

- *Closeness*: Average inverse distance from a code to all others (both directions).

- *BetweennessRSP*: How often a code appears on all randomly selected shortest paths.

- *Betweenness*: Frequency with which a code lies on the shortest paths between other codes.

- *Diffusion*: Likelihood that activity or influence spreads through this code.

- *Clustering*: Tendency of a codeâ€™s neighbors to be interconnected.



You can exclude irrelevant centralities by removing their names from the `Centralities` box. To add them back, select from the drop-down list of all available centralities.

To include loops (edges that return to the same code), check the `Loops?` option. 

If you need calculations based on normalized values, check the `Normalize?` box.

The centrality measures table is accompanied by visualizations. You can choose how many columns to use when displaying these visualizations by selecting the correct number in `Columns`.
