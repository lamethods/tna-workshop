Click on `Centrality Measures`  in the left tab to view key network metrics for each code, including closeness, out-strength centrality, and diffusion.

You can exclude irrelevant centralities by removing their names from the `Centralities` box. To add them back, select from the drop-down list of all available centralities.

To include loops (edges that return to the same code), check the `Loops?` option. 

If you need calculations based on normalized values, check the `Normalize?` box.

The centrality measures table is accompanied by visualizations. You can choose how many columns to use when displaying these visualizations by selecting the correct number in `Columns`.
