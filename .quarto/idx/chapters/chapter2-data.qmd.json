The TNA app supports multiple data types for upload, including **Sequence Data** (see section 2.2), **Long Data** (see section 2.3), and **Transition Matrices** (see section 2.4). Additionally, users can explore the app using built-in **Sample Data** (see section 2.1). You can find your options under `Data Input`.\n\n![](vis/fig2.png)\n\nAfter you have uploaded your data, you will have to select the analysis that you want to perform. Here are your options:\n\n**Relative Analysis**: TNA analysis based on Markov modeling that calculates probabilities of transitions. For this analysis, you need ordered coding of your data, i.e., the order of codes (actions).\n\n**Frequency Analysis**: frequency-based TNA analysis that models frequencies of transitions between codes. Similarly to relative analysis, you need ordered coding of your data, i.e., the order of codes (actions).\n\n**Co-occurence Analysis**: co-occurence TNA does not focus on modeling transitions but shows the co-occurrence of codes within one unit of analysis. For this analysis, a binary coding (0-1) of your acions should be sufficient.\n\nSuccessful analysis will result in a summary document under the data preview that includes\n\n`State Labels`: the list of all codes that are included in the analysis\n\n`Transition Probability Matrix`: if you selected **relative** analysis, you will see a matrix showing the transition probabilities between codes. \n\n`Transition Frequency Matrix`: if you selected **frequency** analysis, you will see a matrix showing the transition frequencies between codes. \n\n`Co-occurence Matrix`: if you selected **co-occurence** analysis, you will see a matrix of code co-occurence within one unit.\n\n`Initial Probabilities`: this metrics indicates the probability of a code to be the first code in the sequence.\n\n![](vis/fig7.png)\n\n\nIf you don't have your own data, you can select `Sample Data`.
