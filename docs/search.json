You can choose how many columns to use when displaying these visualizations by selecting the correct number in Columns.\n\nTo compare two models and determine whether their differences are statistically significant, you can perform a Permutation test by checking the corresponding box. This test works by repeatedly shuffling and comparing the data to generate a distribution of differences under the null hypothesis. You can also adjust the number of Iteratations to control how many permutations are performed, which affects the accuracy of the resulting significance estimate, and set the level of stastical significance that you are interested in. Finally, you can also conduct a Paired test, when the two groups have the same size (e.g., pre-post test). When you run the permutation and statistical tests, the Mosaic and Centralities tabs are automatically updated to reflect the results.

You can find your options under Data Input.\nAfter you have uploaded your data, you will have to select the analysis that you want to perform. Here are your options:\nRelative Analysis: TNA analysis based on Markov modeling that calculates probabilities of transitions between actions. For this analysis, you need ordered coding of your data, i.e., the order of codes (actions).\nFrequency Analysis: Frequency-based TNA analysis that models frequencies of transitions between codes. Similarly to relative analysis, you need ordered coding of your data, i.e., the order of codes (actions).\nCo-occurence Analysis: Co-occurence TNA does not focus on modeling transitions but shows the co-occurrence of codes within one unit of analysis. For this analysis, a binary coding (0-1) of your acions should be sufficient.\nSuccessful analysis will result in a summary document under the data preview that includes\nState Labels: the list of all codes that are included in the analysis\nTransition Probability Matrix: if you selected relative analysis, you will see a matrix showing the transition probabilities between codes.\nTransition Frequency Matrix: if you selected frequency analysis, you will see a matrix showing the transition frequencies between codes.\nCo-occurence Matrix: if you selected co-occurence analysis, you will see a matrix of code co-occurence within one unit.\nInitial Probabilities: this metrics indicates the probability of a code to be the first code in the sequence.",

This is to avoid considering the transitions between two actions that happened too far apart from one another.\nDate format: you can specify the date format that you are using in the time variable if not automatically recognized.
