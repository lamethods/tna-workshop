You can find your options under Data Input.\nAfter you have uploaded your data, you will have to select the analysis that you want to perform. Here are your options:\nRelative Analysis: TNA analysis based on Markov modeling that calculates probabilities of transitions. For this analysis, you need ordered coding of your data, i.e., the order of codes (actions).\nFrequency Analysis: frequency-based TNA analysis that models frequencies of transitions between codes. Similarly to relative analysis, you need ordered coding of your data, i.e., the order of codes (actions).\nCo-occurence Analysis: co-occurence TNA does not focus on modeling transitions but shows the co-occurrence of codes within one unit of analysis. For this analysis, a binary coding (0-1) of your acions should be sufficient.\nSuccessful analysis will result in a summary document under the data preview that includes\nState Labels: the list of all codes that are included in the analysis\nTransition Probability Matrix: if you selected relative analysis, you will see a matrix showing the transition probabilities between codes.\nTransition Frequency Matrix: if you selected frequency analysis, you will see a matrix showing the transition frequencies between codes.\nCo-occurence Matrix: if you selected co-occurence analysis, you will see a matrix of code co-occurence within one unit.\nInitial Probabilities: this metrics indicates the probability of a code to be the first code in the sequence.",
